\description{
Data for mediation analysis of liver protein expression.
Dataset is a list of objects for target, mediator, annotation, covar (covariates),
qtl.geno.
There are 192 diversity outbred mice and 8050 genes with measured mRNA expression.
The 'target' is the level of expression of gene 'Tmem68'.
The mRNA transcript expression is measured for 8050 genes in 'mediator'.
The 'annotation' has positional information for each of the genes.
The 'covar' has Sex and Diet information for the 192 mice.
The 'qtl.geno' object has the allele probabilities for the 8 founder genotypes for the 192 mice
at the location of the Tmem68 gene.
